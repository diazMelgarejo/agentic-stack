"""Cross-platform locked append for episodic JSONL writes.

POSIX `write(2)` in O_APPEND mode is atomic for payloads up to PIPE_BUF
(4 KB on Linux, 512 B minimum per POSIX). Most episodic entries fit,
but failure entries with reflection + context + detail can exceed that,
and two harness hooks writing from the same process (or from two Pi
sessions on the same repo) can interleave bytes mid-line. Silent
corruption is worse than a visible error because every downstream
reader (`auto_dream.py`, `cluster.py`, `context_budget.py`,
`show.py`) skips `JSONDecodeError` lines without surfacing the loss.

This module serializes appends with `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` on POSIX.
On platforms without `fcntl` (native Windows Python) the lock is a
no-op and behavior matches the pre-lock baseline. WSL, git-bash via
Cygwin, macOS, and Linux all provide `fcntl`.
